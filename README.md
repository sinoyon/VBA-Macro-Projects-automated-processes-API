This repository is a collection of my VBA projects and their related posts. VBA-Macro-Projects automated processes, UserForm, Windows Application Programming Interface(API).


VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is a programming language that is built into Microsoft Office applications such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. VBA allows you to automate tasks within these applications, such as data manipulation, chart creation, and report generation.

Here is an example of VBA code that will automate the task of creating a new worksheet in an Excel workbook:

///
Sub CreateNewWorksheet()
    'Create a new worksheet
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add(After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Count))
    ws.Name = "New Worksheet"
End Sub

///
